              Make cool stuff for us! Good design can transport audiences (and
              actors!) to old Georgia manor houses, cramped apartments, and
              bloody battlefields. Watch this space to find out when we're
              looking for designers or email us if you've got good ideas and
              need a stage to use 'em!
