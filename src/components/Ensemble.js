                    <p>Katie Warren is very excited to be a part of "Bridges of Madison County" and "Loving, Repeating" for the Ensemble Theater of Chattanooga. Previous roles she has performed include Buttons in "Lying in State", Miss Hannigan in "Annie", and Despina in Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte". When she is not on the stage, she is in the classroom, spreading her love of music to her students as an elementary music teacher. She has a passion for theater, and looks forward to what this year will bring.</p>
